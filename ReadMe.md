# Mimic Knight

I saw the trailer for Pale Court and got a little impatient.

Replaces Shade Soul with the Pure Vessel's soul daggers.
Daggers do 40 damage, but don't bypass invulnerability.
Shaman Stone increases damage by 1.25x, and increases size by 1.3x.
Flukenest applies a 0.25x multiplier, but causes it to hit twice, and bypasses invulnerability.

Replaces Descending Dark with Paintmaster Sheo's red paint splatter.
Each orb and shockwave does 20 damage.
Shaman Stone increases damage by 1.2x, and increases size by 1.3x.

Adds a new mechanic to spells: The neutral spell.
Hold no directional input and cast a spell and gain access to a fourth spell type. Shade soul and its replacements can still be accessed by holding a horizontal direction when you cast.

Adds Hornet's string attack as a neutral spell.
Each tick does 20 damage.
Shaman stone increases damage by 1.25x and increases size by 1.3x.

Requires Vasi (I don't know how to set dependencies, but it's needed.)
